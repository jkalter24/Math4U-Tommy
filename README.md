- [x] Fix The Logo Height and Width; ALSO CHANGE TO JUST CHARACTER (Joseph) 
- [x] Add Math Function (Emir)
- [ ] Add Incorrect / Error handling for math (Mason / Emir)
- [ ] Add Lore (Nick)

## To-Do
- [ ] Fix it so if you get a math question correct it takes a point of happinies away.
- [ ] Do the same if you get it correct.
